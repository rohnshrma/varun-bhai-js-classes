// output

console.log("hello varun bhai"); // Prints "hello varun bhai" to the console, typically for debugging or logging purposes.

// alert("hello varun bhai"); // Displays a simple alert box with the message "hello varun bhai". Commented out, so it won't execute.

// window.alert("hello varun bhai"); // Similar to alert(), displays an alert box with the message "hello varun bhai" using the window object explicitly. Commented out, so it won't execute.

// document.write("hello world"); // Writes "hello world" directly to the HTML document, replacing its content if called after page load. Commented out, so it won't execute.

// input

// prompt("Enter your name :", "john doe"); // Displays a dialog box asking the user to input text, with "Enter your name :" as the message and "john doe" as the default input value. Commented out, so it won't execute.

// variables

// var age = 23; // Declares a variable named 'age' using 'var' and initializes it with the value 23. Commented out, so it won't execute.

// var yourAge; // Declares a variable named 'yourAge' using 'var' without initializing it (value is undefined). Commented out, so it won't execute.

// yourAge = 34; // Assigns the value 34 to the previously declared 'yourAge' variable. Commented out, so it won't execute.

// const myName = "john"; // Declares a constant named 'myName' and initializes it with the string "john". Constants cannot be reassigned after declaration. Commented out, so it won't execute.

// myName = "varun"; // Attempts to reassign the constant 'myName' to "varun", which would cause an error because constants cannot be reassigned. Commented out, so it won't execute.

// yourAge = 1000; // Assigns the value 1000 to the variable 'yourAge'. Would work if 'yourAge' was previously declared with 'var', 'let', or as a global variable. Commented out, so it won't execute.

// console.log(myName, yourAge); // Prints the values of 'myName' and 'yourAge' to the console. Since both variables are not defined (due to being commented out), this would cause a ReferenceError if executed. Commented out, so it won't execute.
