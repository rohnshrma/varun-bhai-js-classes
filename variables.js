// var age = 23; // Declares a variable named 'age' using 'var' and initializes it with the value 23. Commented out, so it won't execute.

// var yourAge; // Declares a variable named 'yourAge' using 'var' without initializing it (value is undefined). Commented out, so it won't execute.

// yourAge = 34; // Assigns the value 34 to the previously declared 'yourAge' variable. Commented out, so it won't execute.

// const myName = "john"; // Declares a constant named 'myName' and initializes it with the string "john". Constants cannot be reassigned after declaration. Commented out, so it won't execute.

// myName = "varun"; // Attempts to reassign the constant 'myName' to "varun", which would cause an error because constants cannot be reassigned. Commented out, so it won't execute.

// yourAge = 1000; // Assigns the value 1000 to the variable 'yourAge'. Would work if 'yourAge' was previously declared with 'var', 'let', or as a global variable. Commented out, so it won't execute.

// console.log(myName, yourAge); // Prints the values of 'myName' and 'yourAge' to the console. Since both variables are not defined (due to being commented out), this would cause a ReferenceError if executed. Commented out, so it won't execute.
